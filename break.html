<p id="description">The final project of the course of Graphic Production was to create a package that join two distinct products. Therefore, the products we chose was an assortment of chocolates of Regina and the Nespresso coffee. Given that the chocolates Regina chosen had three different flavors, we joined them with three different coffee flavors. So, we have three groups: milk chocolate with Volluto coffee, white chocolate with Livanto coffee and dark chocolate with cosi coffee. The final package is the junction of two elements. A first box with three glass bottles with three different flavors of coffee beans and a second box, with the different boxes containing the different sets. The pattern and the colors of them vary according to the set. The main box is entirely lined in white velvet with a small detail, which is also in the case with glass bottles: on the outside has a symbol in golden in low relief. These two boxes were built with pressboard. Finally the two boxes are surrounded by a kind of band, in blank card, which at the top has a handle to facilitate transport. The whole idea of ​​this package is designed for the family, for the possibility of share and the possibility of transport from one house to another. This band has it also the symbol common in the other boxes, applied in gold cut vinyl with the name of the package "Break".</p>
